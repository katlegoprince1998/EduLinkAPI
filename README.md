# EduLinkAPI
This is a multi relationship REST API. I used spring boot to build this API which you can perform CRUD operations. Entities consist of relationship like, many-to-one and one-to-one. Student entity embedded two entities which consist of information related to the Student Entity. To see more about the entitie's relationships and properties click the link below:

  --Controls end-point
Entity
  --Consist of aall entities
Repository
  --Extends JpaRepository to access CRUD Services
Services
  --All the business logic is written here
